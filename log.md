# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 27, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continue learning CSS Flexbox & CSS Grid curriculum on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
Continue learning on [SoloLearn.com](https://www.sololearn.com). 

**Thoughts:** There is SO much to learn about CSS, but if I persevere and dedicate time to coding every day, even if it's only 15 minutes, it helps me remember and apply what I just learned. Also, using the SoloLearn app is more convenient when I'm learning on the train, but using my laptop is easier to actually write code and take notes. I finished the CSS Flexbox section during the day & will begin to work my way through CSS Grid this evening.

**Today's Progress**: Coninue CSS Grid curriculum on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts**: Finished CSS Flexbox. Woot! Didn't get very far on CSS Grid... but that's okay. Tomorrow's a new day ;).

### Day 3: November 29, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grid on freecodecamp.org. 

**Thoughts**: So. Sleepy. Must. Code. Feeling super committed to learning. Working full-time and trying to be a self-taught developer is difficult, but not impossible. Inspired by reading about other developers' journeys on [Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-landed-a-full-stack-developer-job-without-a-tech-degree-or-work-experience-6add97be2051?source=email-5e0746fca25d-1543503274724-digest.reader------0-59------------------7fc307b3_0aa9_4151_9f87_9be57a255846-1&sectionName=top&gi=a00f26e00f51). 

I completed 75% of the CSS Grid challenges... & I'm satisfied with that. After I finish CSS Grid, I move onto my FIRST responsive web design projects. YASSSSSS!

Must sleep.

### Day 4: November 30, 2018 - Friday

**Today's Progress**: Catching up on the morning of December 1st... didn't do my hour after the craziest day at work yesterday. It's okay though... I'm getting an hour in this morning by finishing CSS Grid & moving onto my first responsive web design project. 

**Thoughts**: I have to go back and reference my notes A LOT when finishing some of the challenges. Reinforcement happens from practice & repitition... so onward I must go. Relieved that I finished CSS grid and move onto my first project. Le sigh of relief.

### Day 5: December 1, 2018 - Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started Tribute Page for FCC - Responsive Web Design Project. 

**Thoughts**: I spent WAY too much time trying to decide on who to make a tribute page for. I ended up deciding on Mirabai, a Bhakti saint from India who low key started a fememist movement. She defied social norms during her lifetime in the 1500s, devoting herself to God & the Hindu god Krishna, instead of her royal life. 

### Day 6: December 2, 2018 - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Mirabai Tribute page. 

**Thoughts**: It was easier than I thought it would be. I'm happy about that :)

### Day 7: December 3, 2018 - Monday

**Today's Progress**: Start 2nd Responsive Web Design Project: Create a Survey Form. 

**Thoughts**: I had a confusing moment where I tried to copy+paste my code from codepen.io into a GitHub repository and found out the hard way that GitHub doesn't work like that.  I finished a good portion of my survey form & hope to completely finish by tomorrow.

### Day 8: December 4, 2018 - Tuesday 

**Today's Progress**: Finished 2nd Responsive Web Design Project: Create a Survey Form. Start 3rd project, build a product landing page.

**Thoughts**: I was able to finish my survey form, which took a little longer than I expected. I changed a few things with the styling and made sure to pass all 17 tests. I keep using colors in the periwinkle family in my projects. I <3 periwinkle.
