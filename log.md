# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 27, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continue learning CSS Flexbox & CSS Grid curriculum on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
Continue learning on [SoloLearn.com](https://www.sololearn.com). 

**Thoughts:** There is SO much to learn about CSS, but if I persevere and dedicate time to coding every day, even if it's only 15 minutes, it helps me remember and apply what I just learned. Also, using the SoloLearn app is more convenient when I'm learning on the train, but using my laptop is easier to actually write code and take notes. I finished the CSS Flexbox section during the day & will begin to work my way through CSS Grid this evening.

**Today's Progress**: Coninue CSS Grid curriculum on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts**: Finished CSS Flexbox. Woot! Didn't get very far on CSS Grid... but that's okay. Tomorrow's a new day ;).

### Day 3: November 29, 2018 - Thursday

**Today's Progress**: CSS Grid on freecodecamp.org. 

**Thoughts**: So. Sleepy. Must. Code. Feeling super committed to learning. Working full-time and trying to be a self-taught developer is difficult, but not impossible. Inspired by reading about other developers' journeys on [Medium](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-landed-a-full-stack-developer-job-without-a-tech-degree-or-work-experience-6add97be2051?source=email-5e0746fca25d-1543503274724-digest.reader------0-59------------------7fc307b3_0aa9_4151_9f87_9be57a255846-1&sectionName=top&gi=a00f26e00f51).
