# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 27, 2018 - Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continue learning CSS Flexbox & CSS Grid curriculum on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org).
Continue learning on [SoloLearn.com](https://www.sololearn.com). 

**Thoughts:** There is SO much to learn about CSS, but if I persevere and dedicate time to coding every day, even if it's only 15 minutes, it helps me remember and apply what I just learned. Also, using the SoloLearn app is more convenient when I'm learning on the train, but using my laptop is easier to actually write code and take notes. I finished the CSS Flexbox section during the day & will begin to work my way through CSS Grid this evening.
